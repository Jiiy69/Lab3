            <h2>How to use iframes in HTML</h2>
            <p>An iframe, or inline frame, is an HTML element that allows you to embed another document within the current HTML document. It is commonly used to display content from other websites, such as videos, maps, or advertisements, without leaving the current page. By using an iframe, developers can ensure that the embedded content is isolated from the main page's HTML and CSS, providing a seamless user experience. Additionally, iframes can be resized and styled to fit the design of the website, enhancing visual appeal. However, it's important to manage iframe usage carefully to avoid potential security issues, such as clickjacking or content manipulation.</p>

This tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not need a closing tag and is an essential element for enhancing the visual appeal of web content.</p>
